The human brain is fascinating. You can know that "I ain't doing the grammar right" has some issues, and you can know that "I am not using correct grammar" *feels* much better. But to go from one to the other, or to explain what is wrong with the first one, is more intellectually demanding.

Similarly in Japanese. 「ご迷惑をかけてすみません。」is fine, but not 「ご邪魔をかけてすみません。」 The first (go-meiwaku-o-kakete-sumimasen) is "sorry for disturbing you". The second, just changes "meiwaku" to "jama", and in this context they mean just about the same thing.
