My presentation at Strata EU 2018 (on how QQ Trend are applying cutting-edge text processing and deep learning technologies to make professional translators more efficient) went fairly smoothly. I got some interesting questions, and also some useful feedback afterwards (one glaring mistake in the slides has been fixed)!

The slides are probably not that useful by themselves, but hopefully are helpful to remind you of the key points if you were able to attend the talk. If you have any questions, either comment here, or send me an email (found in the slides).
